# Skin Cancer Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## 1. Motivation and Objective

Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and dangerous types of cancer worldwide. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment, yet it remains a challenging task due to the subtle differences between benign and malignant lesions. The goal of this project is to develop an automated system using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to assist in the accurate and early detection of skin cancer. This system aims to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable tool to improve diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes.

## 2. Project Overview

In this project, we developed a CNN model to classify images of skin lesions into categories such as benign and malignant. The model was trained on a publicly available dataset of labeled skin lesion images and achieved an accuracy of around 96%.

## 3. Steps Taken

1. **Data Collection**: Curated a dataset of skin lesion images from [Dataset Source].
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Applied image augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset and ensure the model generalizes well.
3. **Model Development**: Developed a CNN model with [number] layers using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Training and Validation**: Trained the model on the dataset, optimized hyperparameters, and validated the model using cross-validation.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## 6. Future Work

- **Model Deployment**: Plan to deploy the model as a web application using Flask/Django to make it accessible for real-world use.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Integrate transfer learning to improve model accuracy further and experiment with different architectures.

## 7. Working Video

Here’s a video demonstrating the model in action, showing how it processes input images and provides predictions:
